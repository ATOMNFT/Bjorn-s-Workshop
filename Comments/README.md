## ‚¨Ü Update Highlights 11/19/24 ‚¨Ü <br> Added install script
I have developed a streamlined installation script to simplify the setup process with minimal user input.
<br>
To use it:
<br>
Download the install_comments.sh script and transfer it to the /home/bjorn directory on your Raspberry Pi. Tools like FileZilla or similar file transfer software are recommended for this step.
Open an SSH terminal (e.g., PuTTY) and execute the following commands:
<br>
- chmod +x install_comments.sh
- sudo ./install_comments_fixed.sh

## Manual installation
To use the file you must remove the "Viking-Styled-" and just leave comments. Make sure it stays as a .json file.
<br>

To upload the file, on a windows pc download or open filezilla and connect to your bjorn using the credentials 
you setup during installation of bjorn. the address should be bjorn.local
<br>

If you need to use the ip address of bjorn instead of the hostname, then scan your network and locate his ip address
<br>

Once your logged into your bjorn navigate to /home/bjorn/Bjorn/resources/comments and make a backup of the original comments.json file to your pc and then upload the viking themed comments json to the folder. (Remember to rename the file)
<br>

It will ask you to overwrite, hit yes and then go reboot your bjorn in the webui of bjorn. 

<br>

### I'm also working a writeup on how to edit/change the .json file for comments as you must keep the structure intact.

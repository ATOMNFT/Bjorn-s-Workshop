To use the file you must remove the "Viking-Styled-" and just leave comments. Make sure it stays as a .json file.
<br>

To upload the file, on a windows pc download or open filezilla and connect to your bjorn using the credentials 
you setup during installation of bjorn. the address should be bjorn.local
<br>

If you need to use the ip address of bjorn instead of the hostname, then scan your network and locate his ip address
<br>

Once your logged into your bjorn navigate to /home/bjorn/Bjorn/resources/comments and make a backup of the original comments.json file to your pc and then upload the viking themed comments json to the folder. (Remember to rename the file)
<br>

It will ask you to overwrite, hit yes and then go reboot your bjorn in the webui of bjorn.

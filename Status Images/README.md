you setup during installation of bjorn. the address should be bjorn.local
<br>

If you need to use the ip address of bjorn instead of the hostname, then scan your network and locate his ip address
<br>

Once your logged into your bjorn navigate to /home/bjorn/Bjorn/resources/XXXXXXX and make a backup of the original comments.json file to your pc and then upload the viking themed comments json to the folder. (Remember to rename the file)
